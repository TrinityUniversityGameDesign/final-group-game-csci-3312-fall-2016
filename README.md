Gameplay Philosophy
* The game will be a series of three randomly selected stages (from a pool of many possible stages) where up to 4 players compete with each other to win the stage. This is followed by a special 4th stage where the winner of the introductory stages competes against the other players to win a final stage (and all the glory). 
* Each initial stage should be a single-screen experience and should enable up to 4 simultaneous players. These stages should allow as few as 2 players.
..* If there are fewer than 4 players, should there should be AI players to bring the total up to 4, or should the game still work with 2 or 3 players?
* Score information (or at least "win/loss" information should be retained between stages.
